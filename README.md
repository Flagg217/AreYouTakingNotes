# AreYouTakingNotes


## Description

This is a simple note-taking application that allows you to create, view, and edit notes. The application is divided into two main pages: a landing page and a notes page.

**Landing Page**

The landing page contains a link to the notes page. When you open the note-taking application, you will be presented with the landing page.

**Notes Page**

The notes page contains a list of all of your existing notes in the left-hand column and empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.

**Saving Notes**

When you enter a new note title and the note's text, a Save icon will appear in the navigation at the top of the page. To save your note, click on the Save icon.

**Viewing Notes**

To view an existing note, click on the note in the list in the left-hand column. The note will appear in the right-hand column.

**Creating New Notes**

To create a new note, click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page. Empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text will appear in the right-hand column.
